# WBEE stands for Web Based Entrance Examination System.
This system was developed using PHP and Javascript. This system was designed to conduct online examination. 
As a user admin (teachers) can login and set exam and questions paper, on the other hand user (students) can log in and attend the exam. 
Check my youtube video for the demo version of the project.
